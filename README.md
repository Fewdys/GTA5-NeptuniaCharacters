## Instructions For Installing
#### Open 'OpenIV' Enter Edit Mode, Then Search For The Name Of The File For The Neptunia Character You Want To Add (Including The Extension - For Example .ytd) Click The 'Copy to "mods" folder' When It Shows Up, Then Replace The File It Copied With The One From The Neptunia Folder In Which You Searched For. 
#### Example: Adult Neptune
##### 1. Open The Folder You Downloaded (Neptunia Characters) Click On Adult Neptune Folder, Copy The Name Of One Of The Files In There (Including The Extension - For Example .ytd) With The Example Being Adult Neptune You Would Copy One Of These Names - a_f_y_genhot_01.ydd, a_f_y_genhot_01.yft, a_f_y_genhot_01.ymt & a_f_y_genhot_01.ytd
##### 2. Open 'OpenIV' Enter Edit Mode and Search For The Name You Just Copied With The Example Being Adult Neptune - It Would Be Whatever Name You Copied From The Folder Aka (a_f_y_genhot_01. Whichever One Of The 4 Extensions You Copied)
##### 3. Click The 'Copy to "mods" folder' Thats In Red
##### 4. Drag and Drop The Files From The Neptunia Character Your Adding (Adult Neptune For The Example) Into The Folder You're On In 'OpenIV' If For Whatver Reason You Clicked Into Something Else After Clicking 'Copy to "mods" folder' Just Search For The File Again - a_f_y_genhot_01 With One Of The Extensions and Make Sure You Click One Which Follows The Path Of Your Mods Folder An Example Of This Can Be Something Like A:\GTA5\mods\x64e.rpf\models\cdimages\componentpeds_a_f_y.rpf, Personally I Recommend Searching For The .yft File For Each That You Want To Replace. Anyways (With The Example Being Adult Neptune, The Character Files Will Be The Following - a_f_y_genhot_01.ydd, a_f_y_genhot_01.yft, a_f_y_genhot_01.ymt & a_f_y_genhot_01.ytd)
##### 5. Done

#### If You Want To Use The Characters Online Download The Online Bypass and Be Sure To Place The Two Files In Your GTA5 Directory
